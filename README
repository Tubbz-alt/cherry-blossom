Cherry Blossom is a blogging system written in Python. It was written specifically because I had a lot of pyblosxom blog entries on my previous blog, but I wanted to use cherrypy instead of plain-ol cgi. It adds features like object publishing, session support, access to lots of cherrypy plugins, access to GET and POST vars as method parameters, and others.

This software's been running my blog for over a year now, and has survived a couple redditings and a flood from stumbleupon, all without a hiccup. 

Why You Should Use It

1. Simplicity.

2. Simplicity.

3. Very like pybloxsom in its design, but unlike it because it runs on a modern app server (cherrypy), which gives you much more power than CGI.

4. No database!

5. It's fast.

6. It's stable - I've been running and developing it for over a year at this point, with very few glitches.

7. It's designed for developers.

8. It's already got lots of plugins, and they're all readable.

8. Simplicity! You can pick it up and grok it in an afternoon, and write your own useful plugins with as little as 5 lines of code.
